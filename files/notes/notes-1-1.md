Welcome to Deep Learning for Coders! In this first lesson, we learn about what deep learning is, and how it's connected to machine learning, and regular computer programming. We get our GPU-powered deep learning server set up, and use it to train models across vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. We do this all in Jupyter Notebooks, using transfer learning from pretrained models for the vision and NLP training.

We discuss the important topics of test and validation sets, and how to create and use them to avoid over-fitting. We learn about some key jargon used in deep learning.

We also discuss how AI projects can fail, and techniques for avoiding failure.

## Questionnaire

The questions below are the same as those in the book. For more, including detailed answers and links to the video timeline, have a look at Radek Osmulski's [aiquizzes](http://aiquizzes.com/howto).

(If you're not sure of the answer to a question, try watching the next lesson and then coming back to this one, or read the first chapter of the book.)
